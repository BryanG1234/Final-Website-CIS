        <h2 class="display-5">Facts about fires</h2>
        <p class="lead">There are several important characteristics regarding fires. Some are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spread Quickly: A fire can double its size every 30 seconds. Within minutes, a small flame can turn into a major fire that engulfs an entire room or building. </li>
          <li></li>Cause Toxic Smoke: Most fire-related deaths are caused by toxic smoke, not burns.</li>
          <li>Can heat the air: Fires use oxygen to improve themselves and can heat up the air we breathe to dangerous levels. This air can burn our lungs, and melt clothes in our bodies.</li>
          <li>They can happen anywhere. Fires can destroy buildings, homes, and personal belongings in a short amount of time. Recovering from the physical damage caused by fires can be costly and emotionally draining.</li>
          <li>Make a plan on what to do in the event of a fire; extinguisher, escape from the area, etc</li>
          <li>Small Fires: Can be tamed or controlled early with fire extinguishers or sprinklers. </li>
        </ul>
