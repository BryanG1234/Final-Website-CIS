        <h2 class="display-5">Facts about fires</h2>
        <p class="lead">There are several important characteristics regarding fires. Some are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spread Quickly: A fire can double its size every 30 seconds. Within minutes, a small flame can turn into a major fire that engulfs an entire room or building. </li>
          <li>Cause Toxic Smoke: Most fire-related deaths are caused by toxic smoke, not burns.</li>
          <li>Can heat the air: Fires use oxygen to improve themselves and can heat up the air we breathe to dangerous levels. This air can burn our lungs, and melt clothes in our bodies.</li>
          <li>They can happen anywhere. Fires can destroy buildings, homes, and personal belongings in a short amount of time. Recovering from the physical damage caused by fires can be costly and emotionally draining.</li>
          <li>Make a plan on what to do in the event of a fire; extinguisher, escape from the area, etc</li>
          <li>Small Fires: Can be tamed or controlled early with fire extinguishers or sprinklers. </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Procedures to follow during a fire</h3>
            <p>There are several steps to follow in the event of a fire. These may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid toxic gas and smoke by crawling near the floor</li>
                <li>Identify your options for getting out of the building</li>
                <li>Feel the doorknob to see if it's hot, or if there’s smoke coming through the door. If there is, abandon the door and go with a different route</li>
                <li>Open doors slowly, mindful of what's on the other side. Close the door if lots of smoke or fires are present.</li>
                <li>If you cannot escape from the building, hunker down in a room, barricading any place Smoke might come through.(Cracks through the door, vents, etc)</li>
                <li>If you catch fire, do the tried and tested method of stopping, dropping, and rolling. When assisting someone on fire, using a fire extinguisher, or smothering the flames with a non-flammable or flame retardant item like a heavy jacket or blanket.                      Provide first aid to any burns and direct them to emergency services. </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Insurance Claims: Begin the process of documenting the damage for your insurance company. Take photos and keep detailed records of any items lost or damaged.</li>
